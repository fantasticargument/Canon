								<div class="list">When removing jammed paper or when inspecting the inside of the machine, do not expose yourself to the heat emitted from the fixing unit and its surroundings for a prolonged period of time. Doing so may result in low temperature burns, even though you did not touch the fixing unit and its surroundings directly, as this may result in burns.</div>
								<div class="list">If paper is jammed, remove the jammed paper so that any pieces of paper do not remain inside the printer according to the displayed message. Also, do not put your hands forcibly into the parts other than those directed on the screen. Failure to do so may result in burns or injuries.</div>
								<div class="list">When removing jammed paper or replacing a toner cartridge, be careful not to get any toner on your hands or clothing, as this will dirty your hands or clothing.
