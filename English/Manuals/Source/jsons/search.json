Toner may peel when printouts are folded or creased. ¶Store printouts in the condition where they are not folded or creased as toner may peel. ¶Put printouts in a binder when storing for a long period of time (two years or longer). ¶Printouts may discolor when stored for a long period of time. ¶Avoid storing printouts in a location subject to high temperatures. ¶Precautions when sticking printouts with adhesive¶Be sure to use insoluble adhesive. ¶Test the adhesive on an unneeded printout before using. ¶Before stacking printouts that stuck with adhesive, check that the adhesive completely dried. ¶¶",category:"06000000",title:"Precautions for Paper",keywords:""},{toc_id:"06010020",body:"Printable Area¶¶NOTE¶If you want to extend the printable area¶Specify the following settings in the printer driver.¶¶1.¶Click [Advanced Settings] in the [Finishing] sheet.¶2.¶Set [Print with Upper Left of Sheet as Starting Point] to [On]. ¶¶¶¶The edges of the printout may be partly missing depending on the property of the document to be printed. ¶¶¶Plain Paper/Heavy Paper/Transparency/Label¶You cannot print on any area within 5 mm of the edges of paper.¶¶Envelope¶This printer can print on the following area.¶You may have to change the printable area before printing, depending on the application you use.¶¶¶¶",category:"06000000",title:"Printable Area",keywords:""},{toc_id:"06020000",body:"Paper Loading and Output¶This printer has the following paper source and output destination.¶¶Paper Source¶(A): Multi-purpose tray¶&quot;Loading Paper&quot;¶Output Destination¶(B): Output tray¶Outputs paper with the printed side facing down.¶Open the output tray before printing.¶¶¶¶¶¶Paper Capacity of the Paper Source and Output Destination¶Paper Type¶Paper Source¶Output Destination¶Multi-purpose Tray¶Output Tray*¶Plain paper (Ex. 75 g/m²)¶Approx. 150 sheets¶Approx. 100 sheets¶Heavy paper (Ex. 91 g/m²)¶Approx. 100 sheets¶Approx. 50 sheets¶Heavy paper (Ex. 128 g/m²)¶Approx. 60 sheets¶Approx. 30 sheets¶Transparency¶Approx. 100 sheets¶Approx. 10 sheets¶Label¶Approx. 50 sheets¶Approx. 10 sheets¶Envelope¶Approx. 10 sheets¶Approx. 10 sheets¶¶¶¶¶*¶Actual paper capacity varies depending on the installation environment and paper type to be used.¶¶¶¶¶",category:"06000000",title:"Paper Loading and Output",keywords:""},{toc_id:"06020020",body:"Loading Paper¶¶¶For details on the paper that you can load in the multi-purpose tray, see &quot;Usable Paper.&quot;¶¶¶¶Before loading paper, see &quot;Attention (Paper Loading).&quot;¶¶1¶Open the multi-purpose tray.¶¶¶¶¶2¶Slide the paper guides a little wider and longer than the actual paper size.¶¶¶3¶Gently load paper with the printing side facing up until it touches the back of the tray.¶Be sure to load paper in portrait orientation.¶¶IMPORTANT¶When loading envelopes¶See &quot;Printing on Envelopes&quot; and load the paper in the correct orientation.¶¶¶NOTE¶When loading paper with a letterhead or logo¶See &quot;Paper Loading Orientation&quot; and load the paper in the correct orientation.¶¶¶¶¶4¶Align the paper guides with the loaded paper.¶¶IMPORTANT¶Be sure to align the paper guides with the paper.¶If the paper guides are too loose or too tight, this may result in misfeeds or paper jams.¶¶¶¶¶¶5¶Make sure that the paper stack is loaded under the load limit guides (A) or the hook (B) on the paper guide.¶¶For details on the basic printing procedure, see &quot;Basic Printing Procedure.&quot;¶¶¶If printing custom size paper, you need to register the custom paper size in the printer driver previously.¶&quot;Registering a Custom Paper Size&quot;¶¶¶When paper runs out during printing, the  (Paper) indicator (orange) blinks.
